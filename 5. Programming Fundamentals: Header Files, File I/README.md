### Fundamentals of Programming : Functions, Header Files, File I/O, Arrays, Random Numbers, and Recursion
The assignment encompasses the use of functions and header files for organizing code, and challenges students with tasks involving file input/output operations for data handling. Students are also required to manipulate arrays and implement random number generation techniques. Another significant aspect of the assignment is the application of basic recursion, demonstrated in a creatively designed task. Throughout the assignment, emphasis is placed on developing skills in key areas such as ANSI C++ compatibility, Linux/Unix environment compatibility, and following good programming practices and coding style guidelines. This comprehensive approach ensures students gain a robust understanding of these fundamental programming concepts.
