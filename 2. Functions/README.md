# Functions
This repository aims to show enhance problem-solving skills in C++ by focusing on creating organized, modular code with minimal content in the `main.cpp` file. The lab emphasizes the use of various programming constructs such as data types, user input, conditional branches, loops (including nested loops), functions, and the use of header files. Students are expected to choose and solve one of the provided problems, demonstrating their solution during lab hours. While working outside lab hours isn't required, preparation and understanding of the lab material beforehand are encouraged. The lab provides an opportunity to practice coding skills in a controlled environment, with support available for questions, preparing students for independent problem-solving in exams.
