# Calculator
This project involves developing a program to automate the calculation of change in retail transactions. It efficiently computes the exact denominations of dollar bills, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies to be returned to customers, given the total purchase amount and the amount paid. The software aims to enhance accuracy and speed in cashier operations, with specialized functions for each type of currency denomination. This tool is particularly useful in settings where quick and precise cash handling is essential, and it adheres to the specific constraint of using only certain bill and coin denominations. The project showcases skills in algorithm development, handling of floating-point operations, and user interaction in a practical, real-world application.
