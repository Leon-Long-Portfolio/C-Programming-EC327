# Data Structures
This project focuses on enhancing C++ programming skills through the development of a program that computes the mode(s) of a dataset. Key areas of focus include working with arrays, file input/output, integrating multiple source and header files, and utilizing makefiles for compilation. The primary tasks involve writing functions to read an array of integers from a file and to find the mode(s) of this array, handling cases with multiple modes. The project aims to solidify understanding of array manipulation, efficient data processing, file handling, and the overall structure and organization of a C++ program. The outcome is a functional application that can read data from provided files, calculate the mode(s), and display the results, demonstrating practical application of these fundamental programming concepts.
