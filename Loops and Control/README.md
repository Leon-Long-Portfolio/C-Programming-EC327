# Loops and Control
This project covers essential programming concepts including data types, user input, conditional branches (if, else, if-else), loops (do-while, for, while), and nested loops. It is designed to enhance practical understanding and application of these fundamental areas in programming. The focus is solely on these technical topics, providing a comprehensive learning experience in these key areas of programming.

Diagonal
This programming task requires creating a program that prompts users to input an integer `N` within the range 1 to 9. If the input is valid, it prints a diagonal line from `N` to 1. If `N` is outside this range, it displays "Invalid value for N!" and exits. The program keeps running, allowing for multiple inputs, until an invalid `N` is entered, utilizing a `do-while` loop for this purpose.
