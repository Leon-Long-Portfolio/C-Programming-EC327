# Quadratic Solver
This project entails creating a C++ program comprising a main function, function implementations, and function prototypes across separate files. The main task is to develop a custom square root function without using the standard `<cmath>` library. This function is then utilized to calculate and display both positive and negative roots of quadratic equations. Users will input the coefficients of the equation and a tolerance level for the square root calculation. The program allows solving multiple equations in a session, with an option for the user to exit upon completion.
