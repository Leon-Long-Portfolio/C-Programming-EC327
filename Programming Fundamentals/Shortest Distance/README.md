# Shortest Distance
The task involves developing a C++ program that calculates the shortest distance from a point to a line, integrating both programming and mathematical principles. This requires reading user-provided coordinates, applying geometric formulas to determine a line's equation, and then accurately computing the perpendicular distance from a third point to this line. Precision is crucial, as the program must output the distance with at least two decimal places. Overall, this question combines elements of software development with computational geometry, highlighting the intersection of computer engineering and applied mathematics in solving real-world problems.
```
❯ ./shortest_distance                           
Enter three x,y coordinates:
1 2 2 3 2 4
The shortest distance for (2,4) to the line composed of (1,2) and (2,3) is 0.707107.

❯ ./shortest_distance
Enter three x,y coordinates:
2 4 6 7 5 9 
The shortest distance for (5,9) to the line composed of (2,4) and (6,7) is 2.2.
