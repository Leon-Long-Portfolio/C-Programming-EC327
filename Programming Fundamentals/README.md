# Programming Fzundamentals
The primary objective of this programming assignment is to apply fundamental C++ programming concepts, including data types, conditional statements, loops, and basic functions, to solve a series of distinct problems. The assignment comprises five questions, each targeting specific skills: calculating the shortest distance from a point to a line using geometric principles, developing a simple "rock, paper, scissors" game with user input and random choice generation, computing the Hamming distance between two numbers in hexadecimal format, determining whether a given number is a palindrome, and implementing character manipulation with ASCII values. This assignment aims to strengthen the understanding and application of essential programming constructs in real-world scenarios, enhancing problem-solving abilities and proficiency in C++ programming.
