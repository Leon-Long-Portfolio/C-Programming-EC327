# C++ Game: COVID Outbreak
The project for the EC327: Introduction to Software Engineering course (Fall 2021) offers an immersive experience in advanced programming, culminating in the development of a complex game simulation titled "COVID Outbreak: Escape the Fall Semester". This comprehensive project is tailored to enhance students' proficiency in ANSI C++ and object-oriented programming, positioning them effectively for careers in software development, game design, and systems engineering.

**Key Objectives and Computer Science Topics Covered:**

1. **Object-Oriented Programming and Encapsulation**: The project begins with the creation of user-defined types and the application of encapsulation principles. Students craft various classes like `Point2D`, `Vector2D`, `GameObject`, and building-specific types such as `DoctorsOffice` and `ClassRoom`, laying a foundational understanding of object-oriented design.

2. **Interacting Objects and MVC Pattern**: A significant focus is on the interaction between various game objects, utilizing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. This approach highlights the dynamic interactions and dependencies within software systems.

3. **Dynamic Allocation and Standard Template Library (STL)**: Advancing into more complex territory, the project integrates dynamic allocation and the use of the STL for efficient data management and memory optimization, skills crucial in high-level software development.

4. **Exception Handling and Input Validation**: Exception handling is introduced to streamline input error processing, emphasizing the development of robust and user-friendly software.

5. **Program Persistence and File I/O**: A critical component involves saving and loading game states, teaching students about persistence in software applications and file handling, essential for applications dealing with user data.

6. **Advanced Features and Innovation**: The project encourages creative thinking and problem-solving by allowing students to implement advanced functionalities like computer-mode gameplay, adaptive virus behavior, and dynamic object interactions.
